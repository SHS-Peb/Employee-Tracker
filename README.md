# Employee trac

This week I had to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases a CMS. I had to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application cannot be deployed, I have created a short walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met.
